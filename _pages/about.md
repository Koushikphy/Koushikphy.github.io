Hi there, I'm **Koushik Naskar**, a Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Computational Sciences, working at the intersection of AI, automation, and real-world problem solving.

Professionally, I build AI-driven tools to automate workflows, improve efficiency, and turn ideas into scalable solutions. My work focuses on applying advanced GenAI techniques to solve real-world problems and create practical impact across complex systems.


In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, experimenting with ideas, and building personal projects  that start as ideas and often become useful tools. Check out the [Projects page](/projects) to know more about the tools I built.
